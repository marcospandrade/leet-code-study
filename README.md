# 🧠 Coding Challenges Solutions

Welcome to my repository of algorithmic coding challenges! This repo contains solutions to problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, written in **TypeScript** and documented for learning and sharing.



## 📌 Overview

This repository is designed to:

- Track my progress solving coding challenges.
- Showcase clean, readable, and well-documented solutions.
- Help others learn from my thought process and approaches.

Each solution includes:

- ✅ Working TypeScript code
- 💡 Intuition behind the approach
- 🧭 Step-by-step explanation
- ⏱️ Time and space complexity analysis

## 🧪 Technologies

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Style:** Clean code, ES6+, functional and efficient
